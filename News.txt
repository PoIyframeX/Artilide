Greetings everyone! Today is the day of Artilide's full release, along with the server!

This update primarily contians numerous content additions and bug fixes found in the stress test and development server.

Updates may be a little slower then previously, but this is because I want updates to be big and meaningful.

Have fun playing Artilide! I do have big plans for next update so do keep a look out though.

Hello again! Today is the day of the server wide stress test!

This test's results will primarily dictate in what is worked on in the next update in terms of optimizations.

If everything goes to plan, and no optimizations are needed, expect a update to release shortly.

I will inform everyone on the results of the stress test, and what I will be doing next in result of it.

Hello everybody! I am very happy to announce that Artilide is now finally in *early access*!

Now, you're probably wandering, what will dictate the full release?

Well, this early access phase is because at the moment, there will be *many* balancing issues, bugs, and crashes.

Due to this, the modpack is being restricted to a couple of members, which includes *you*!

Do expect at any time things to change or break, and please report any bugs you encounter into the Discord server!
