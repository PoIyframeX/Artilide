Hello everybody! I am very happy to announce that Project Connected is now finally in *early access*!

Now, you're probably wandering, what will dictate the full release?

Well, this early access phase is because at the moment, there will be *many* balancing issues, bugs, and crashes.

Due to this, the Project is being restricted to a couple of members, which includes *you*!

Do expect at any time things to change or break, and please report any bugs you encounter into the Discord server!
